# Angular Tests
This is my personal basket of tests with AngularJS and Angular6-7.

# 
## Prerequisites
This series of projects runs with NodeJs, which has to be installed on your machine, or you have to start a webserver of your choice pointing to this directory as the wwwroot.

Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rick-1990/AngularTests/
```
Get into the project folder

From there you can start exploring all the projects and tests published in this repo.
