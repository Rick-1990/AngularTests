# Geocoding with AngularJS, ngGeolocation and Nominatim
This project relies on:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), the de-facto standard styling framework
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), MVW framework to create dynamic apps
- [ngGeolocation](https://github.com/ninjatronic/ngGeolocation), a wrapper of the HTML5 geolocation functions in AngularJS
- [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/), a search engine for OpenStreetMap data, used to do reverse geocoding here
- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), a collaborative project that aims to build a free editable map of the world

I focused on the Nominatim API because it is open source and can be installed on a server, be it personal or on an enterprise server farm, so you don't have to pay for services like the Google Geolocation API or others, even for large amounts of requests.
